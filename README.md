Hello! As you can see in the files I've uploaded, this is a project I did in 2024, the aim was to assist in the monitoring of data to assist with mental health issues and improve daily life.

I've used Python and a Microbit (Embedded System) to help bring this project to life. This project helped me with learning how to analyse data, use code to help portray data and help create more data with my test cases.
